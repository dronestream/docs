# Description

> Built for commercial, government and hobbyist pilots. 
We simplify the process of sharing a live feed from a drone.

Current streaming facilities for drone operators are limited to being shared with social media and other unrelated outputs. We aim to change that.

To answer the needs of the commercial and emergency service sectors, pilots will be able to set up private groups to live stream to (and those viewers will receive a push notification when streaming begins).

The stream itself will allow viewers to communicate via a messenger to the pilot (received in the form of a notification banner above the DJI Go app). Other features include a map and battery life indicator the pilot can choose to share with viewers, with the ability to download the stream to your device once its finished.


The hobbyist will be able to enjoy the same features but most of all make great use of the public streams via a 'news feed' style format, in addition to being able to follow their favourite pilots.

We look forward to seeing your stunning live streams!
