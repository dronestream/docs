This will present all the public live streams from all over the world in one place, alowing us all to view the beautiful new perspectives DJI gives us!

### Pilots and drone location is shared
Great for those with clients, crew or specialists based off-site, giving them a better awareness of the environment and geography.

### Follow Pilots
Allows you to always be in the know when your favorite pilots start streaming.

### Download finished streams
Perfect for creatives to start work on the rough-cuts until they receive delivery of the high-resolution finished product, or those that wish to analyse the stream closely

### Chat
The pilot and the viewers can communicate with each other directly during the stream

### Two methods of connecting to the drone
As some would like to swiftly stream out, Dronestream has the 'plug-and-play' ability where you will simply connect the drone to the RC and the stream is ready to go. 
The second method is via RTMP via the DJI Go app, this means that you can still make use of all the fantastic features flying via DJI Go, all while your stream feeds through to Dronestream via DJI's 'custom RTMP' option.
